# Stochastic Signal Processing Course

## Overview
This course covers probabilistic models for stochastic signals and systems, focusing on analysis, processing, and estimation techniques. Builds on deterministic signals by addressing noise and uncertainty using probability theory and statistics.

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
- **CLO1**: Analyze general mathematical models for characterizing random experiments (and signals) and extract useful information through those models.
- **CLO2**: Compute power spectral density of random signals using several variants of periodograms and be able to analyze information content therein.
- **CLO3**: Apply optimal linear methods for the prediction and denoising of wide-sense stationary random signals.
- **CLO4**: Design and apply a class of estimators for the parameter estimation from random signals.
